# CC Lib Example Repo

An example of a well structured C/C++ project repository.

I am mostly using this for my own personal learning, reference, and
experimentation with build systems and other matters.

I also use this for adding small snippets and tests of general things.

## Tooling Dependencies

For working on the project you will need the following:

- CMake
- Ninja
- Clang
  - clang-tidy
  - clang-check
  - clang-format
- GCC if you wish
- rtags


## Build Instructions

If you just want to build and use the software yourself:

- CMake
- C++ Compiler (Clang, GCC, etc.)
